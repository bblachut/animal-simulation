## Project for OOP class.
It's simulation of animal lives. Animals are shown as arrows and their color depends on amount of energy they have. Their genotypes determine a movement (0-forward, 4-backward, else-rotate). If two animals with enough energy meet, they breed. Their child's genotype is a mix of parents' genotypes. Every day at a map are spawned 2 plants, one in the jungle (middle terrain) and one on the steppe. When an animal is on the same square with a grass it eats and gets energy.

There are 2 maps (one isn't folded so animals are blocked by borders), each one has own stats and and option to track an animal (see amount of descendants, children and day of death).
